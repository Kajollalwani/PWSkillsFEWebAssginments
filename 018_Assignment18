Q1. Explain the role of operators in JavaScript. Why are they essential in programming?
Certainly! Here’s a concise explanation of the role of operators in JavaScript and why they are essential:
Role of Operators in JavaScript

Operators in JavaScript perform operations on variables and values, enabling you to manipulate data and control the flow of execution in your programs. They allow you to:
1.Perform Calculations:Arithmetic operators enable mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2.Compare Values: Comparison operators check relationships between values, such as equality or greater-than, which is crucial for decision-making in code
3.Make Decisions:Logical operators help combine conditions and make decisions based on multiple criteria.
4.Assign Values:Assignment operators simplify the process of assigning and updating variable values.
5. Control Flow: Conditional (ternary) operators provide a shorthand for simple conditional statements, making the code more concise.

Why Operators Are Essential:
1.Data Manipulation:Operators allow you to perform essential calculations and transformations on data, which is fundamental for processing information in any application.
2.Conditional Logic:Operators enable you to compare values and make decisions, which is vital for implementing logic and branching in your code.
3.Efficient Coding:By using operators, you can write more concise and readable code, reducing the need for verbose conditional statements and manual calculations.
4.Control Flow:They help in controlling the flow of your program by enabling the evaluation of expressions and conditions that determine which blocks of code to execute.
In summary, operators are indispensable in JavaScript for performing operations, making decisions, and controlling program flow, all of which are central to effective programming.

Q2. Describe the categorization of operators in JavaScript based on their functionality. Provide examples for
each category.
In JavaScript, operators are categorized based on their functionality into several types. Here’s an overview of these categories along with examples for each:
1.Arithmetic Operators
Functionality:Perform mathematical operations.
Addition (+):Adds two numbers.
  let sum = 5 + 3; // sum is 8
  
Subtraction (-): Subtracts one number from another.
  let difference = 5 - 3; // difference is 2
Multiplication (*):Multiplies two numbers.
  let product = 5 * 3; // product is 15
Division (/): Divides one number by another.
  let quotient = 6 / 3; // quotient is 2
Modulus (%):Returns the remainder of a division.
  let remainder = 5 % 3; // remainder is 2
Exponentiation (**):Raises a number to the power of another.
  let power = 2 ** 3; // power is 8
Increment (++) and Decrement (--):Increases or decreases a number by one
  let a = 5;
  a++; // a is now 6
  let b = 5;
  b--; // b is now 4

2. Comparison Operators
Functionality: Compare two values and return a boolean result.
Equal to (==):Checks if two values are equal.
  let isEqual = (5 == '5'); // isEqual is true

Strict equal to (===):Checks if two values are equal and of the same type.
  let isStrictEqual = (5 === 5); // isStrictEqual is true

Not equal to (!=):Checks if two values are not equal.
  let isNotEqual = (5 != 3); // isNotEqual is true

Strict not equal to (!==):Checks if two values are not equal or not of the same type.
  let isStrictNotEqual = (5 !== '5'); // isStrictNotEqual is true

Greater than (>), Less than (<), Greater than or equal to (>=), Less than or equal to (<=):Compare numerical values.
  let greaterThan = (5 > 3); // greaterThan is true
  let lessThan = (5 < 3); // lessThan is false
  let greaterOrEqual = (5 >= 5); // greaterOrEqual is true
  let lessOrEqual = (5 <= 4); // lessOrEqual is false

 3. Logical Operators
Functionality:Combine multiple boolean expressions.
AND (&&): Returns true if both expressions are true.
  let andResult = (true && false); // andResult is false
OR (||):Returns true if at least one expression is true.
  let orResult = (true || false); // orResult is true
NOT (!):Returns true if the expression is false.
  let notResult = !true; // notResult is false
 4. Assignment Operators
Functionality: Assign values to variables.
Assignment (=): Assigns a value.
  let x = 5; // x is now 5

Addition assignment (+=):Adds a value to a variable and assigns the result.
  let a = 5;

 5.Conditional (Ternary) Operator
Functionality:Provides a shorthand for simple if-else statements.
Ternary (? :): Evaluates a condition and returns one of two values.
  let age = 18;
  let canVote = (age >= 18) ? 'Yes' : 'No'; // canVote is 'Yes'

 6.Type Operators
Functionality: Check or convert types.
typeof:Returns the type of a variable.
  let type = typeof 5; // type is 'number'
instanceof:Checks if an object is an instance of a particular class or constructor.
  let arr = [];
  let isArray = arr instanceof Array; // isArray is true
These operators are crucial for performing a wide range of tasks in JavaScript, from basic arithmetic to complex logical operations and value assignments. They help in making decisions, controlling program flow, and manipulating data efficiently.

Q3. Differentiate between unary, binary, and ternary operators in JavaScript. Give examples of each.
In JavaScript, operators are classified based on the number of operands they operate on. Here’s a detailed differentiation between unary, binary, and ternary operators, along with examples for each:
1. Unary Operators:Unary operators operate on a single operand. They perform operations such as negation, incrementing, or type conversion.
Examples:
Unary Plus (+):Converts its operand to a number.
  let num = +"5"; // num is 5 (number)
Unary Negation (-): Converts its operand to a negative number.
  let num = -5; // num is -5

Increment (++) and Decrement (--):Increases or decreases a variable’s value by 1.
  let x = 5;
  x++; // x is now 6
  let y = 5;
  y--; // y is now 4

Logical NOT (!):Inverts the boolean value of its operand.
  let isTrue = true;
  let isFalse = !isTrue; // isFalse is false

Typeof:Returns the type of its operand.
  let type = typeof 5; // type is 'number'
Delete:Deletes a property from an object.
  let obj = {name: 'Alice'};
  delete obj.name; // deletes the 'name' property from obj

2. Binary Operators
Definition:Binary operators operate on two operands. They are used for various operations, including arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations.
Examples:Arithmetic Operators:
Addition (+):Adds two numbers.
    let sum = 5 + 3; // sum is 8

Multiplication (*): Multiplies two numbers.
    let product = 5 * 3; // product is 15

Comparison Operators:
Equal to (==):Checks if two values are equal.
    let isEqual = (5 == '5'); // isEqual is true
Greater than (>):Checks if one value is greater than another.
    let isGreater = (5 > 3); // isGreater is true
Logical Operators:
AND (&&):Returns true if both operands are true.
    let andResult = (true && false); // andResult is false
OR (||):Returns true if at least one operand is true.
    let orResult = (true || false); // orResult is true

Assignment Operators:
Assignment (=): Assigns a value to a variable.
    let x = 5; // x is 5
Addition assignment (+=):Adds a value to a variable and assigns the result.
    let y = 5;
    y += 3; // y is now 8
3. Ternary Operator
The ternary operator is a conditional operator that operates on three operands. It provides a shorthand for an if-else statement.

Syntax:
condition ? expr1 : expr2
Examples:
  let age = 18;
  let canVote = (age >= 18) ? 'Yes' : 'No'; // canVote is 'Yes'
  In this example, if `age` is greater than or equal to 18, `canVote` will be `'Yes'`; otherwise, it will be `'No'`.
Unary Operators work with a single operand to perform operations like incrementing, negating, or type conversion.
Binary Operators work with two operands to perform operations such as arithmetic calculations, comparisons, and logical operations.
Ternary Operator works with three operands and provides a concise way to write conditional expressions.

Q4. Discuss the precedence and associativity of operators in JavaScript. Why is understanding these concepts
important?
Precedence refers to the order in which operators are evaluated when multiple operators are present
in an expression. Operators with higher precedence are executed first. For example, in the expression 3 + 5 * 2,
multiplication (*) has higher precedence than addition (+), so the multiplication is performed first
const result = 3 + 5 * 2; // The result will be 13, not 16 (if addition had
higher precedence)
Associativity refers to the order in which operators of the same precedence are evaluated. Some operators
associate left to right, meaning they are evaluated from left to right. Others associate right to left, meaning they
are evaluated from right to left.
const result = 10 + 5 + 2; // The result will be 17 (evaluated as (10 + 5) + 2)

Importance of Understanding Precedence and Associativity
Predictability: Knowing operator precedence and associativity ensures that expressions are evaluated as expected, avoiding logical errors.
Code Clarity: Helps write clearer and more maintainable code by reducing the need for unnecessary parentheses.
Debugging: Understanding these concepts aids in debugging complex expressions and helps identify why certain results are returned.
Avoiding Errors: Proper use of precedence and associativity prevents common mistakes such as incorrect order of operations, which can lead to bugs and unintended behavior.

Q5. Write a JavaScript program that calculates the simple interest using the formula Simple interest =
(principal * rate * time) / 100.
const principal = 1000
const rate = 5
const time = 2 // in years
const result = (principal * rate * time)/100
console.log("Simple Interest =", result)

Q6. Write a Javascript program to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) using the formula BMI = weight (kg)/
height * height.
const height = 160 // in cm
const weight = 55 // in kg
const BMI = weight/ height * height
console.log("BMI =", BMI)

Q7. Write a program in JavaScript to calculate the area of a circle given its radius value of 10. Use
appropriate arithmetic operators.
const radius = 10; // Radius of the circle
// Calculate the area of the circle: area = π * radius^2
const pi = Math.PI; // Approximate value of pi
const area = pi * Math.pow(radius, 2);
console.log("Area of the circle:", area);



                                                            Introduction to JavaScript and its fundamentals
Question 1: Explain what JavaScript is and its role in web development.
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language commonly used in web development to create interactive and dynamic content on websites. It enables client-side scripting, which allows web pages to respond to user actions, manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), and communicate with servers without reloading the page.
Role in Web Development:
Interactivity: Enhances user experience by adding features like animations, form validation, and dynamic content updates.
Client-Side Scripting: Runs in the user's browser, reducing server load and improving responsiveness.
Web APIs: Integrates with web APIs to fetch and display data asynchronously, enabling smooth and interactive applications.
Frameworks and Libraries: Powers popular frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, Vue) and libraries (e.g., jQuery) that streamline and enhance development.

Question 2: Explain the key differences between JavaScript and HTML. Provide examples of situations where
you would use each.
JavaScript and HTML serve different purposes in web development:
JavaScript
Purpose: A programming language used to create interactive and dynamic functionality on web pages.
Key Role: Adds behavior to web pages, such as handling user events, modifying content, and communicating with servers.
Example Use Case: Implementing form validation or creating a dynamic image slider
// Example: Alert user on form submission
document.getElementById("myForm").addEventListener("submit", function(event) {
    alert("Form submitted!");
    event.preventDefault(); // Prevent actual form submission for demonstration
});
HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
Purpose: A markup language used to structure and present content on web pages.
Key Role: Defines the structure and layout of a web page using elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and images.
Example Use Case: Creating a basic web page layout or displaying static content.
<!-- Example: Basic HTML structure -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
</body>
</html>
JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior.
HTML provides the structure and content of the web page.

Question 3: List and describe the five primitive data types in JavaScript.
JavaScript has five primitive data types, each representing a basic type of data. Here’s a brief description of each:

1. Number
Description: Represents both integer and floating-point numbers.
Example: let age = 25; or let price = 19.99;
2. String
Description: Represents a sequence of characters enclosed in single quotes ('), double quotes ("), or backticks (`).
Example: let greeting = "Hello, world!";
3. Boolean
Description: Represents a value of either true or false, often used for conditional statements.
Example: let isActive = true;
4. Undefined
Description: Represents a variable that has been declared but not yet assigned a value. The default value of uninitialized variables.
Example: let name; // name is undefined
5. Null
Description: Represents the intentional absence of any object value, used to indicate that a variable should not point to any object.
Example: let user = null;
Summary
Number: Numeric values (e.g., 25, 3.14).
String: Text values (e.g., "hello", 'world').
Boolean: True or false values (e.g., true, false).
Undefined: Variable without a value assigned.
Null: Explicitly no value or object.

Question 4: What is the purpose of declaring variables in JavaScript, and how do you declare them using the
'let' keyword?
In JavaScript, the purpose of declaring variables is to store and manage data that can be used and manipulated throughout a program. Variables provide a way to label and access values, making code more readable and manageable.

Declaring Variables with let
Purpose of let:

Block Scope: Variables declared with let are limited to the block in which they are defined, such as within a function or a loop.
Reassignable: Unlike const, variables declared with let can be reassigned new values.
Syntax
let variableName = initialValue;
Example 
let age = 30;         // Declare a variable 'age' with initial value 30
age = 31;             // Reassign 'age' to 31
Using let ensures that the variable is only accessible within the block it is declared, preventing unintended interactions outside of that scope.

Question 5: Explain the importance of comments in JavaScript and provide examples of single-line and
multi-line comments.
Importance of Comments in JavaScript:
Code Documentation: Comments help explain and clarify the purpose and functionality of code, making it easier to understand and maintain.
Code Readability: They improve readability by providing context and explanations, which is especially useful for others reviewing or collaborating on the code.
Debugging: Comments can be used to temporarily disable parts of the code for testing and debugging without deleting the code.
Types of Comments
Single-Line Comments

Syntax: Use // to comment out a single line.
// This is a single-line comment
let x = 10; // Initialize variable x
Multi-Line Comments

Syntax: Use /* to start and */ to end a multi-line comment.
/*
  This is a multi-line comment.
  It can span multiple lines.
*/
let y = 20;

Summary:

Single-Line Comment: // for brief explanations.
Multi-Line Comment: /* ... */ for longer explanations or commenting out multiple lines.

Question 6: Explain the importance of choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript.
Provide an example where using a clear identifier improves code readability.
Choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript is crucial for code readability and maintainability. 
It helps developers understand the purpose of the variable without needing extra comments or explanations. 
Clear identifiers make the code easier to debug and modify, especially when working in teams or revisiting the code later.
example
// Unclear identifier
let x = 20;
let y = x * 12;

// Clear identifier
let hourlyRate = 20;
let annualSalary = hourlyRate * 12;
In the second example, hourlyRate and annualSalary make the code much more readable and intuitive.
