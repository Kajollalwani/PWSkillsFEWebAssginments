                                              Operations in Javascript(Part-2)Assignment

1.Explain the usage of ternary operator with syntax and write a program to check whether the number is even
or odd using the ternary operator.
The ternary operator in JavaScript is a concise way to write an if-else statement. 
It takes three operands: a condition, a value if the condition is true, and a value if the condition is false.
     Syntax:
condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse;
 EXAMPLE:
let number = 7;
let result = (number % 2 === 0) ? "Even" : "Odd";
console.log(result);  // Output: Odd
In this program, the ternary operator checks if the number is even or odd and assigns the result accordingly.

2.Describe the usage of the comma operator in JavaScript and provide an example.
The comma operator in JavaScript allows multiple expressions to be evaluated in a single statement, with the result of the last expression being returned.

Usage:
It is often used to include multiple operations in places where only one expression is expected, such as in a loop or initialization.
Example:
let x = (1, 2, 3);
console.log(x);  // Output: 3
Here, the comma operator evaluates 1, 2, and 3, but the final result of the entire expression is 3, the last value.

3.Use a nested ternary operator to check that a number is positive, negative or zero. You have to print
“positive” if the number is positive and similarly for negative and zero also.
let number = -5;

let result = (number > 0) ? "Positive" : 
             (number < 0) ? "Negative" : "Zero";

console.log(result);  // Output: Negative
In this code, the first ternary checks if the number is greater than 0 (positive), the second checks if it is less than 0 (negative), otherwise, it defaults to zero.

4.Use a ternary operator to check that a person is eligible to vote or not by checking his age. If the age of the
person is less than 18 then “You cannot vote” should be logged else “You can vote” should be logged.
let age = 17;

let result = (age >= 18) ? "You can vote" : "You cannot vote";

console.log(result);  // Output: You cannot vote
In this code, the ternary operator checks if the person's age is 18 or above. If true, it logs "You can vote," otherwise "You cannot vote."
